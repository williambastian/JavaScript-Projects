#Pizza Menu
This project contains a clickable menu with lists of various toppings, priced individually. Submitting your order calculates the order's total price.

#Tic Tac Toe game
This is a personalized game of tic tac toe, using cows and spaceships in place of X's and O's. When three symbols are placed in a row, a line draws through the series of three. Unique sounds play for placing symbols, playing to a win, or playing to a draw.

#Calculator
This is a basic four function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and clear inputs on this browser based calculator.
